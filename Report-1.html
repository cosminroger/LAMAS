<h2 style="text-align:center">Introduction</h2>

<p style="width: 500px;" align="justify" style="text-align:justify" >

Nowadays, we keep hearing of the term <b>blockchain</b> and <b>cryptocurrency</b>, and although the second term is, at least in concept, well known, the first is not fully understood by many people. 
In the present project, we are going to investigate how messages are sent among agents in a blockchain, make attempts at falsifying blockchain information and show how these are getting rejected. 
We will provide a (simplified) blockchain model with the intent of graphically demonstrating all the perks of sending information through a blockchain.
Our research question essentially amounts to:
<br>
<b>How does communication between agents work in a blockchain? What happens when not all agents are truthful? How are the messages verified?</b>
 We will attempt to answer all of these questions by implementing our blockchain model, testing it and reporting the results.
<br>
<br>
Essentially all cryptocurrency relies on the blockchain. Cryptocurrency at its core is a method of mainting a <b>decentralised currency</b>, not dependent on a central authority such as a certain goverment or bank as is the case of classical currency.
But then who keeps track of all the transactions that take place and all the sums that everyone has in lieu of a cenbtral bank or authority ? The answer is everybody! 
A blockchain is a system of computers that store and share a common database among all other computers (or participants/agents that are part of that blockchain). Essentially the blockchain can be said to crowdsource all the checks and balances normally performed by a central agency.
So how does that work? Do the agents just have to trust each other? 
That is fortunately not necessary, using concepts from logic such as <b>common knowledge and public announcements</b>, combined with communications protocols and certain algorithms, a blockchain is implemented which keeps tracks of everything and acts as a type of hive mind and impartial arbiter.


<br>
<br>
But what really is a blockchain, how does it work, and how does it implement epistemic logic in its functioning?

</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Blockchain: what it is and how it works</h2>
<p style="width: 500px;" align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
    As mentioned, a blockchain is functioanlly a way to to keep track of transactions. It has the function of being an
     impartial arbiter in deciding how money is being transfered as well as how much each agent has. 
     It essentially guarantees the currency and its trading is fair and all decisions made with respect to it are equitable. 
     <br>
     <br>
     The blockchain can for starters essentially be thought of as a big ledger or database. Within this database we would store 
     all the information about all the trades that were ever made as well as the amount of money each agent has. However unlike classic 
     databases the data is not simply structured in consecutive entries. Data is structured in blocks, esentially a collection of multiple
     transactions or entries in our hypothetical ledger. Each block is filled with a number of transactions, and then added 
     (along with a timestamp) to a chain of such blocks (hence the name) that form an indelible, traceable trade history
      shared amongst all users. This represents the truth that all following blocks have to abide by.
      <br>
      <br>
      So now we've seen how the blockchain is structured from a architectural standpoint, and know how the data stored in it looks, let 
      us discuss how this data is added and verified. Essentially this relies on the decentralization of the blockchain, instead of storing
      all the data in the blockchain in just one centralised location everyone gets a copy of it. Every user has full acces to the aforementioned
      trade history that has been added in the blockchain since the respective user started using that particular cryptocurrency. So when 
      a new transaction is to be added, it goes out to all (or a very large number of) users and compared with their local copy of the 
      blockchain. Should a transaction not line up with this expansive history it can be quickly determined that a fraud attempt took place. 
      Even if multiple users colaborate on the fraud, most blockchains use majority voting (although other algorithms have been known to be 
      employed) to determine wether a transaction can be added or not to a block. As such a fraudster would need to control most of the users
      in a network to perpetuate a fraud. As opposed to a normal currency where all trust is placed in a central authority, all of the users
      of a cryptocurrency get to verify each transaction using the blockchain.
    <br>
    <br>
    In order to understand how a blockchain works let's consider the following example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>Agent A</i> wants to send a message to <i>agent B</i>. 
    Normally, one would send this message and it relies on other entities to make sure that the message got sent, namely, you rely on a third party. If the third party looses the message, or modifies it, it would not be a pleasant experience for the sender. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This is where blockchains come in. These are a growing sequence of blocks which contain approved transaction alongside with a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating the blockchain. 
    So, the new block created at step i will contain an index i, its content D, and the hash of the previous block i-1. This blockchain is stored by every agent and any update needs to be made to the entire sequence. 
    You cannot make a change at a step i-5, for instance, without changing the information in all blocks from i-4 to i. 
    Given how big these blockchains and networks of agents are for some cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum and Bitcoin) and the fact that every message (block) received is further verified by some algorithms to ensure its validity, it is nearly impossible to falsify the information. 
    Not only that one would need to falsify all the blocks up to a point as mentioned before, but it is also mandatory that at least 50%+1 agents from that network to perform the same operations, hence why it would be impossible to falsify the data contained in such a big blockchain.

    So how does this relate to epistemic logic? [to be continued]

<h2 style="text-align:center">Implementation: bringing the blockchain to life</h2>
<p style="width: 500px;" align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
    [work in progress]
    As inspiration for the implementation of epistemic logic for our blockchain, we are used the following article: 
    Brunnler Kai, Flumini, D., & Studer, T. (2020) <i>A logic of blockchain updates</i>. Journal of Logic and Computation, 30(8), 1469â€“1485. 
    Tn this article an entirely new logic system is proposed, namely BCL, where dynamic logic is used to reason about blockchain updates, and finally, prove that BCL is sound and complete
